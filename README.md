Implementation of various classifier

I have implemented four parts,given below

1. Build a decision tree by taking as input a maximum depth and by randomly splitting the 
dataset as 80/20 split i.e., 80% for training and 20% for testing. Provide the accuracy by 
averaging over 10 random 80/20 splits. Consider that particular tree which provides the 
best test accuracy as the desired one. 
2. What is the best possible depth limit to be used for your dataset. Provide a plot 
explaining the same. 
3. Perform the pruning operation over the tree obtained in question 2 using a valid 
statistical test for comparison. 
4. Print the final decision tree obtained from question 3 following the hierarchical levels of 
data attributes as nodes of the tree.
